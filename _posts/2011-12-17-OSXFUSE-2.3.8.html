<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for Xcode 4.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a race condition, that affected only 64-bit kernels and would lead to a file system deadlock. The deadlock could be triggered by trying to remove a non-empty directory. The system daemon <code>fseventsd</code> would eventually lock the whole file system while the "remove" operation is in progress and go to sleep indefinitely, triggering a deadlock. (Reported by Daniel Iwan)</li>
    <li>Fixed a race condition, that affected only 64-bit kernels and would lead to a file system deadlock. The deadlock could be triggered by a <code>LOOKUP</code> operation that locks the whole file systems and goes to sleep, waiting for other file system operations to complete.</li>
    <li>Fixed a race condition, that would lead to a file system deadlock. The deadlock could be triggered by a thread trying to open a file, that another thread had just created (but not opened, yet). (Thanks to Erik Larsson)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Due to the fact that <code>gcc-4.2</code> has been discontinued with the release of Xcode 4.2, default to <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code> instead for Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7 builds.</li>
    <li>The file system locking mechanism, that had been introduced to make <code>osxfusefs</code> thread-safe, is now used under 32-bit kernels and 64-bit kernels. It takes the place of the fallback locking mechanism for non-thread-safe file systems of the 32-bit kernel.</li>
</ul>
