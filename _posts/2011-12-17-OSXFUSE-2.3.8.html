<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Xcode 4.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition, that affected only 64-bit kernels and would lead to
    a file system deadlock. The deadlock could be triggered by trying to remove
    a non-empty directory. The system daemon <code>fseventsd</code> would
    eventually lock the whole file system while the "remove" operation is in
    progress and go to sleep indefinitely, triggering a deadlock. (Reported by
    Daniel Iwan)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition, that affected only 64-bit kernels and would lead to
    a file system deadlock. The deadlock could be triggered by a
    <code>LOOKUP</code> operation that locks the whole file systems and goes to
    sleep, waiting for other file system operations to complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition, that would lead to a file system deadlock. The
    deadlock could be triggered by a thread trying to open a file, that another
    thread had just created (but not opened, yet). (Thanks to Erik Larsson)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Due to the fact that <code>gcc-4.2</code> has been discontinued with the
    release of Xcode 4.2, default to <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code> instead for macOS
    10.6 and 10.7 builds.
  </li>
  <li>
    The file system locking mechanism, that had been introduced to make
    <code>osxfusefs</code> thread-safe, is now used under 32-bit kernels and
    64-bit kernels. It takes the place of the fallback locking mechanism for
    non-thread-safe file systems of the 32-bit kernel.
  </li>
</ul>
