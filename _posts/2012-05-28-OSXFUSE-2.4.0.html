<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added experimental support for OS X 10.8.</li>

    installed in order to build OSXUFSE using Xcode 4.3: Command Line Tools for
    Xcode, Auxiliary Tools for Xcode, Autotools, and Libtool. See
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/blob/osxfuse-2/README.md"

    for more information.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Resolved an issue, that could trigger a
    <code>vnode reclaim in progress</code> kernel panic on macOS 10.5. Tracked
    as issue #16:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/16"
      >"vnode reclaim in progress - NTFS"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in the implementation of the <code>exchange</code> file system
    operation, that could cause data loss or corruption on macOS 10.7 or later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Resolved several issues, that were caused by using the build-time macro
    <code>__FreeBSD__</code> when building <code>libosxfuse</code> bindings for
    various languages. Tracked as issues #17:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/17"
      >"osxfuse.pc contains -D__FreeBSD__=10"</a
    >
    and #25:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/25"
      >"sys/statfs.h included but unnecessary"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue, that could result in FUSE command line options being ignored
    or overwritten when mounting a FUSE volume on 64-bit Macs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue, that could cause OS X to run out of I/O buffer space and
    become unresponsive in rare cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed several issues, that could trigger a kernel panic when interrupting
    file system operations on a FUSE volume.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that was responsible for crashing the Plan 9 FUSE file system
    (9pfuse) when writing on the mounted FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #28:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/28"
      >"Bad length passed to client process in write operation"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in the updater tool, that caused developer releases not
    appearing as an update option.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the FUSE for OS X logo as fallback volume icon, in case a file system
    linked against <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code> does not supply a custom
    volume icon (option <code>volicon</code>). Tracked as issue #27:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/27"
      >"Include default volume icon as framework resource"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Include DWARF version 2 debug information for <code>libosxfuse</code> and
    <code>libmacfuse</code> to make debugging FUSE file systems easier. The
    debug symbol bundles are stored in
    <code>OSXFUSE.framework/Resources/Debug</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Various under-the-hood improvements like enabling support for hidden files
    on FUSE volumes and case-sensitive file systems.
  </li>
</ul>
