<p class="note">
    This is a developer preview of the OSXFUSE software.
</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added experimental support for OS X 10.8.</li> 
    <li>Added support for Xcode 4.3. The following additional packages need to be installed in order to build OSXUFSE using Xcode 4.3: Command Line Tools for Xcode, Auxiliary Tools for Xcode, Autotools, and Libtool. See <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/blob/osxfuse-2/README.md">README.md</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Resolved an issue, that could trigger a <code>vnode reclaim in progress</code> kernel panic on macOS 10.5. Tracked as issue #16: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/16">"vnode reclaim in progress - NTFS"</a>.
    <li>Fixed a bug in the implementation of the <code>exchange</code> file  system operation, that could cause data loss or corruption on macOS 10.7 or later.</li>
    <li>Resolved several issues, that were caused by using the build-time macro <code>__FreeBSD__</code> when building <code>libosxfuse</code> bindings for various languages. Tracked as issues #17: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/17">"osxfuse.pc contains -D__FreeBSD__=10"</a> and #25: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/25">"sys/statfs.h included but unnecessary"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue, that could result in FUSE command line options being ignored or overwritten when mounting a FUSE volume on 64-bit Macs.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue, that could cause OS X to run out of I/O buffer space and become unresponsive in rare cases.
    <li>Fixed several issues, that could trigger a kernel panic when interrupting file system operations on a FUSE volume.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that was responsible for crashing the Plan 9 FUSE file system (9pfuse) when writing on the mounted FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #28: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/28">"Bad length passed to client process in write operation"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the updater tool, that caused developer releases not appearing as an update option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use the FUSE for OS X logo as fallback volume icon, in case a file system linked against <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code> does not supply a custom volume icon (option <code>volicon</code>). Tracked as issue #27: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/27">"Include default volume icon as framework resource"</a>.</li>
    <li>Include DWARF version 2 debug information for <code>libosxfuse</code> and <code>libmacfuse</code> to make debugging FUSE file systems easier. The debug symbol bundles are stored in <code>OSXFUSE.framework/Resources/Debug</code>.</li>
    <li>Various under-the-hood improvements like enabling support for hidden files on FUSE volumes and case-sensitive file systems.</li>
</ul>
