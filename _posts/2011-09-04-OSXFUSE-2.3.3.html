<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added experimental support for macOS 10.5 (Intel and PowerPC). PowerPC
    binaries are only installed on macOS 10.5. In a future release universal
    binaries will be available on macOS 10.6 and 10.7.
  </li>
  <li>
    OSXFUSE can be build against SDKs 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 using Xcode 3.2, Xcode
    4.0 and Xcode 4.1. The latest Xcode version including a specific SDK has the
    highest priority for building against this SDK. The build script locates
    automatically supported Xcode installations in the top-level of the macOS
    startvolume.
  </li>
</ul>
