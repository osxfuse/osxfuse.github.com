<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue, that can trigger a kernel panic in case decrementing the iocount of a vnode results in the vnode being reclaimed. Reported by Daniel Iwan: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/osxfuse-group/EDUQLeOxfNg/discussion">"Panic on Lion with OSXFUSE 2.5.1"</a></li>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that can cause reading from a FUSE device to block although system call <code>select</code> signaled that the read would be non-blocking.</li>
    <li>Addressed an issue, that can trigger a segmentation fault in the user space file system process when unmounting a FUSE volume. No further messages are sent to the server after the session has been destroyed by sending message <code>FUSE_DESTROY</code>.</li>
    <li>Unmounting a FUSE volume does no longer signal <code>VQ_DEAD</code>, which should only be signaled in case the file system died unexpectedly.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in file system operation <code>SETATTR</code>, that resulted in a file's type not being passed to the FUSE server. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Various code improvements resulting in cleaner code. Most of these patches were authored by Anatol Pomozov.</li>
</ul>
