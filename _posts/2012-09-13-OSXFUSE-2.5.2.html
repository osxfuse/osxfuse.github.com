    iocount of a vnode results in the vnode being reclaimed. Reported by Daniel

    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that can cause reading from a FUSE device to block although
    system call <code>select</code> signaled that the read would be
    non-blocking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed an issue, that can trigger a segmentation fault in the user space
    file system process when unmounting a FUSE volume. No further messages are
    sent to the server after the session has been destroyed by sending message
    <code>FUSE_DESTROY</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unmounting a FUSE volume does no longer signal <code>VQ_DEAD</code>, which
    should only be signaled in case the file system died unexpectedly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in file system operation <code>SETATTR</code>, that resulted in
    a file's type not being passed to the FUSE server. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.
