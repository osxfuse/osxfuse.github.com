<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Xcode 6.1</li>
  <li>
    Added support for case insensitive file systems based on OSXFUSE.framework.
    By default all FUSE volumes are treated as case sensitive. See LoopbackFS

      >089a847</a
    >
    for details.<br /><br />Please note that disabling support for case
    sensitive names does not make a FUSE volume case insensitive. It only tells
    the system that the volume should be treated as such.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed an incompatibility with Comodo Antivirus. In rare cases Comodo
    Antivirus might trigger a kernel panic when a FUSE daemon becomes
    unresponsive and the volume is being unmounted.
  </li>
</ul>
