<h3>New Features</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in build script target <code>reload</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code> that may have resulted in the selector <code>removeExtendedAttribute:ofItemAtPath:error:</code> never being called. Tracked as issue #2: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/2">"removeExtendedAttribute never called"</a>. Reported and fixed by Dan Cooper.</li>
    <li>Fixed bundle identifier of the OSXFUSE kernel extension.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Many simultaneous file system operations on an OSXFUSE/MacFUSE volume may trigger a file system deadlock, that renders the file system being unresponsive and therefore being ejected. This bug affects solely Macs running a 64 bit kernel.</li>
