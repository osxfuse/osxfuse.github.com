<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Enhanced MacFUSE compatibility mode to make OSXFUSE compatible with the
    latest TrueCrypt release.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in build script target <code>reload</code>.</li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code> that may have resulted in the
    selector <code>removeExtendedAttribute:ofItemAtPath:error:</code> never
    being called. Tracked as issue #2:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/2"
      >"removeExtendedAttribute never called"</a
    >. Reported and fixed by Dan Cooper.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed bundle identifier of the OSXFUSE kernel extension.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Many simultaneous file system operations on an OSXFUSE/MacFUSE volume may
    trigger a file system deadlock, that renders the file system being
    unresponsive and therefore being ejected. This bug affects solely Macs
    running a 64 bit kernel.
  </li>
</ul>
