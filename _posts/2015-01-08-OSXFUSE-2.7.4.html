<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Restored compatibility with G5-powered (PPC64) Macs running macOS 10.5.
    Tracked as issues #121:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/121"
      >"Doesn't work in PPC Leopard server!?"</a
    >
    and #186:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/pull/186"
      >"Fixes for building and running on Leopard"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that can cause hangs in case a FUSE file system truncates
    write requests without returning an error code. Tracked as issues #187:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/187"
      >"Truncated direct_io writes cause uninterruptible hangs"</a
    >
    and #2:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/kext/pull/2"
      >"Fixes hangs on truncated writes"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed an inconsistency in OSXFUSE.framework. File systems build on top
    of the Objective-C framework do no longer ignore the
    <code>NSFileSize</code> attribute for directories returned by the
    <code>attributesOfItemAtPath:userData:error:</code> callback. Tracked as
    issue #3:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/framework/pull/3"
      >"Set st_size for directories too"</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>
