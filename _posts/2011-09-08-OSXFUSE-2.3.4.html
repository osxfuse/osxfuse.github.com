<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug that triggered a system-wide deadlock, if multiple MacFUSE
    volumes are mounted. This issue had been introduced in OSXFUSE 2.3.1 and
    affected solely MacFUSE file systems based on one of the user space C
    libraries, <code>libfuse</code> or <code>libfuse_ino64</code>. Objective-C
    file systems based on <code>MacFUSE.framework</code> did not trigger the
    deadlock. Tracked as issue #10:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/10"
      >"Deadlock when multiple MacFUSE file systems are mounted"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that prevented the kernel extension from loading on macOS
    10.5 (PowerPC). This was caused by a bug in <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code>.
    Tracked as issue #9:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/9"
      >"osxfusefs.kext does not load on OS X 10.5/ppc"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that caused 64 bit PowerPC file systems to crash. This was
    caused by <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Switched to <code>gcc-4.2</code> as default compiler to address several
    compatibility issues with <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code> on macOS 10.5.
  </li>
</ul>
