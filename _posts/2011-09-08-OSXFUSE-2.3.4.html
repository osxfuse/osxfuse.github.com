<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug that triggered a system-wide deadlock, if multiple MacFUSE volumes are mounted. This issue had been introduced in OSXFUSE 2.3.1 and affected solely MacFUSE file systems based on one of the user space C libraries, <code>libfuse</code> or <code>libfuse_ino64</code>. Objective-C file systems based on <code>MacFUSE.framework</code> did not trigger the deadlock. Tracked as issue #10: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/10">"Deadlock when multiple MacFUSE file systems are mounted"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that prevented the kernel extension from loading on Mac OS X 10.5 (PowerPC). This was caused by a bug in <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code>. Tracked as issue #9: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/9">"osxfusefs.kext does not load on OS X 10.5/ppc"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that caused 64 bit PowerPC file systems to crash. This was caused by <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Switched to <code>gcc-4.2</code> as default compiler to address several compatibility issues with <code>llvm-gcc-4.2</code> on Mac OS X 10.5.</li>
</ul>
