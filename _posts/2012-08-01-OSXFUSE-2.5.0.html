<p class="note">
    This is a developer preview of the OSXFUSE software.
</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Full support for OS X 10.8.</li>
    <li>Full support for Xcode 4.4 on OS X 10.7 and 10.8. See <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/blob/osxfuse-2/README.md">README.md</a> for more information on building OSXFUSE.</li>
    <li>Implemented FUSE device operation <code>select</code>. Using system call <code>select</code> allows waiting for FUSE requests sent from the kernel extension to a user space FUSE daemon in a very efficient manner while handling other events in the same thread. Patch by Thomas Nordin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that can trigger a kernel panic when performing file system operations on a dying FUSE volume. Reported by Andreas Guðmundsson: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/osxfuse-group/zwpaEy6aGZ4/discussion">"panic in fuse_vnop_mmap"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where user space FUSE file systems, that are being unmounted, do not receive reclaim messages before receiving message <code>FUSE_DESTROY</code>. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that can trigger a kernel panic when reading or writing files on a FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #35: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/35">"Kernel panic on osx 10.7"</a>.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that can prevent a multi-threaded FUSE file systems from terminating when receiving singal <code>SIGINT</code> (Ctrl+C). Based on a patch by Anatol Pomozov.</li>
    <li>Addressed an issue, that can result in unexpected behavior of Objective-C FUSE file systems using <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code>. This issue was caused by using a non thread safe file manager instance. Tracked as issue #37: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/37">"ObjC framework should avoid [NSFileManager defaultManager]"</a></li>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that prevents user root from accessing files on a FUSE volume despite mount-time option <code>allow_root</code> being set. The issue is caused by an inconsistent permission check in file system operation <code>access</code>. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue, that triggers a kernel panic on OS X 10.8 in case of a failed mount attempt of a FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #38: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/38">"sshfs-2.4.1 / osxfuse-2.4.2 kernel panic when a remote directory is mounted twice"</a>, issue #43: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/43">Mountain Lion kernal panic</a> and issue #44: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/44">"Mountain Lion kernel panics"</a>.</li>
    <li>Addressed an issue, that can trigger a kernel panic in tight mount/umount cycles on Mac OS X 10.5 and later. Bug reported by Zach Marquez: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/osxfuse-group/Pou_FM8uSYw/discussion">"Kernel panic in tight mount/unmount loop"</a></li>
</ul>
