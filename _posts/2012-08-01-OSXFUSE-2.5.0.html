    for more information on building OSXFUSE.
  </li>
  <li>
    Implemented FUSE device operation <code>select</code>. Using system call
    <code>select</code> allows waiting for FUSE requests sent from the kernel
    extension to a user space FUSE daemon in a very efficient manner while
    handling other events in the same thread. Patch by Thomas Nordin.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that can trigger a kernel panic when performing file system
    operations on a dying FUSE volume. Reported by Andreas Gu√∞mundsson:

      >"panic in fuse_vnop_mmap"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue where user space FUSE file systems, that are being unmounted,
    do not receive reclaim messages before receiving message
    <code>FUSE_DESTROY</code>. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that can trigger a kernel panic when reading or writing files
    on a FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #35:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/35"
      >"Kernel panic on osx 10.7"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that can prevent a multi-threaded FUSE file systems from
    terminating when receiving singal <code>SIGINT</code> (Ctrl+C). Based on a
    patch by Anatol Pomozov.
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed an issue, that can result in unexpected behavior of Objective-C
    FUSE file systems using <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code>. This issue was
    caused by using a non thread safe file manager instance. Tracked as issue
    #37:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/37"
      >"ObjC framework should avoid [NSFileManager defaultManager]"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that prevents user root from accessing files on a FUSE volume
    despite mount-time option <code>allow_root</code> being set. The issue is
    caused by an inconsistent permission check in file system operation
    <code>access</code>. Patch by Anatol Pomozov.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue, that triggers a kernel panic on OS X 10.8 in case of a
    failed mount attempt of a FUSE volume. Tracked as issue #38:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/38"
      >"sshfs-2.4.1 / osxfuse-2.4.2 kernel panic when a remote directory is
      mounted twice"</a
    >, issue #43:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/43"
      >Mountain Lion kernal panic</a
    >
    and issue #44:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/44"
      >"Mountain Lion kernel panics"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed an issue, that can trigger a kernel panic in tight mount/umount
    cycles on macOS 10.5 and later. Bug reported by Zach Marquez:
    <a
      href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/osxfuse-group/Pou_FM8uSYw/discussion"
