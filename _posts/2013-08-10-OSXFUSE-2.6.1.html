<p class="note">
    This is a developer preview of the FUSE for OS X software. It will supersede version 2.6.0 as the new stable release on 19 Aug 2013.
</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improved support for OS X 10.9</li>
    <li>
        Smarter discovery of the "Developer ID Application" and "Developer ID Installer" signing certificates in the user's keychain when building FUSE for OS X. Use the following build script options to specify different certificates:
        <pre>
-j &lt;code signing certificate&gt;
-i &lt;installer signing certificate&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added support for building and installing FUSE for OS X on Mac OS X 10.6 to 10.8 using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for OS X. Tracked as issue #1: <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/1">"allow to define install prefix manually"</a> and pull request #21318: <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/21318">"osxfuse 2.6.1"</a>
