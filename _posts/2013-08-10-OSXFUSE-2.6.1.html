<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved support for OS X 10.9</li>
  <li>
    Smarter discovery of the "Developer ID Application" and "Developer ID
    Installer" signing certificates in the user's keychain when building FUSE
    for OS X. Use the following build script options to specify different
    certificates:
    <pre>
-j &lt;code signing certificate&gt;
-i &lt;installer signing certificate&gt;</pre
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for building and installing FUSE for OS X on macOS 10.6 to
    10.8 using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for OS
    X. Tracked as issue #1:
