<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a permission issue regarding Finder in macOS 10.7. Creating files on a
    OSXFUSE volume, that had not been mounted with option
    <code>allow_other</code>, failed due to a change in Finder. Tracked as issue
    #5:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/5"
      >"Finder permission problem"</a
    >. Fix suggested by Peter Stegemann
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in the OSXFUSE kernel extension, that could render a file system
    unresponsive and therefore being ejected after a timeout. This bug affected
    solely Macs running a 64 bit kernel and was triggered through many
    simultaneous file system operations. Tracked as issue #7:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/7"
      >"Deadlock in filesystem"</a
    >. Fix based on Anatol Pomozov's findings.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Applied Tuxera's MacFUSE 2.2.0/1 patches.</li>
  <li>
    Introduced "fat" distribution package containing different installation
    packages for macOS 10.6 and 10.7.
  </li>
</ul>
