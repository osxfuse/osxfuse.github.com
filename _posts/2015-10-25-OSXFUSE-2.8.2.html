<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved compatibility with Finder. Starting with OS X 10.9
    <code>syspolicyd</code> (which is running as root) calls
    <code>getxattr(2)</code> when opening items in Finder. Blocking these calls
    results in Finder displaying an error message. Therefore we are no longer
    blocking <code>getxattr(2)</code> calls by root even if
    <code>allow_root</code> or <code>allow_other</code> is not set.
    <br />
    <br />
    Tracked as issue #162:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/162"
      >"Preview sets quarantine attribute on all files it opens on an SSHFS
      volume."</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <code>select(2)</code> for FUSE devices on OS X 10.11. The issue was
    caused by a kernel private struct that has changed between OS X 10.10 and
    10.11.
