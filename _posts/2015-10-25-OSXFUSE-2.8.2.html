<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Improved compatibility with Finder. Starting with OS X 10.9 <code>syspolicyd</code> (which is running as root) calls <code>getxattr(2)</code> when opening items in Finder. Blocking these calls results in Finder displaying an error message. Therefore we are no longer blocking <code>getxattr(2)</code> calls by root even if <code>allow_root</code> or <code>allow_other</code> is not set.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tracked as issue #162: <a href="https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/issues/162">"Preview sets quarantine attribute on all files it opens on an SSHFS volume."</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed <code>select(2)</code> for FUSE devices on OS X 10.11. The issue was caused by a kernel private struct that has changed between OS X 10.10 and 10.11.
