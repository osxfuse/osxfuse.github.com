<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for fcntl <code>F_FULLFSYNC</code>. See issue #79:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/79"
      >"Calling fcntl(..., F_FULLFSYNC) on osxfuse volume returns "Invalid
      argument" error"</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Addressed an issue, that could in rare cases lead to a file system deadlock
    and cause a kernel panic when using mount-time option
    <code>nosyncwrites</code>. The issue could be triggered by flushing the
    kernel's file cache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that could trigger a kernel panic when creating a new file on a
    distributed file system failed. Only FUSE file system implementing the
    <code>FUSE_CREATE</code> call were affected by this issue. Tracked as issue
    #84:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/84"
      >"kernel panic related to fuse_ipc.h"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Plugged a memory leak, that occurred when looking up a file or directory
    fails because it does not exist. The issue is fixed by properly releasing
    the otherwise leaked ticket in <code>fuse_vnop_lookup</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plugged a memory leak, that occurred when setting an extended attribute
    failed because of its size. The leak was caused by not releasing the ticket
    in case <code>fdisp_make_vp_canfail</code> failed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition, that could in rare cases trigger a "Data access"
    kernel panic when writing to a file.
  </li>
</ul>
