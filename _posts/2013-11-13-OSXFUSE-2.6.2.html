<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved support for Xcode 5.0.1 and newer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in the Objective-C framework, that could cause a file system
    crash when creating a directory fails, i.e. when the file system delegate
    returns an error in <code>createDirectoryAtPath:attributes:error:</code>.
    Tracked as issue #96:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/96"
      >"Invalid input parameter for createDirectoryAtPath:attributes:error:"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed issue #74:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/74"
      >"cannot copy file system bundle to destination."</a
    >
    by using <code>/bin/cp</code> instead of <code>cp</code> from
    <code>${PATH}</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    When uninstalling, check whether the FUSE for OS X preference pane has
    actually been installed before trying to uninstall it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replaced Package Maker app with <code>pkgbuild(1)</code>. The Package Maker
    app has been deprecated since Xcode 4.6 and has been removed from the
    Auxiliary Tools package for Xcode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added missing <code>fuse.pc</code> symlink for build target homebrew. It is
    needed for compatibility with Linux FUSE file systems and points to
    <code>osxfuse.pc</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
