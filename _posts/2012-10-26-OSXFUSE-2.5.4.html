<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Retina volume icons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition introduced in OSXFUSE 2.5.2, that can result in
    unmounting a FUSE volume taking up to several minutes in some cases.
    Reported by Daniel Iwan:

    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that can cause FUSE file systems to crash when reclaiming a
    vnode after making a hard link to the corresponding file. Error message
    returned by FUSE server:
    <pre>Assertion failed: (node->nlookup >= nlookup)</pre>
    Tracked as issue #55:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/55"

      (encfs)"</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that prevents file nodes from being freed by the FUSE server
    when the corresponding vnodes are being reclaimed by OS X. This could result
    in higher than normal memory usage in case a great number of files is being
    created on a FUSE volume.
  </li>
  <li>
    Addressed an issue, that can trigger an "unknown option" error when using
    mount time option <code>volicon</code> in combination with option
    <code>modules</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug in detecting whether a custom volume icon has been specified
    when mounting a FUSE file system through <code>OSXFUSE.framework</code>. In
    some cases this issue prevented file systems from mounting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug, that can trigger a kernel panic on OS X when entering a vnode
    into the name cache or purging it from the cache.
  </li>
</ul>
