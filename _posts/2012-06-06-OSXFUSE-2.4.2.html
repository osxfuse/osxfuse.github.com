<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Addressed an issue where FUSE file system binaries cannot be executed due to the access permissions for directory <code>/usr/local/lib</code> having been altered by a third party. Issue reported by Peter Stegemann.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug, that prevented non-blocking reads from a FUSE device <code>/dev/osxfuse[0-9]+</code>. Bug reported by Nafid Haque: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/osxfuse-group/NnTIXTTztz0/discussion">"How to do a non-blocking read"</a>.</li>
