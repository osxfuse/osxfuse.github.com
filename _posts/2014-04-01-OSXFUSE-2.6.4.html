<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for case insensitive FUSE file systems. The macro
    <code>FUSE_ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE</code> can be used in the FUSE init
    callback to mark the volume as case insensitive. See
    <a
      href="https://github.com/osxfuse/filesystems/commit/d9a598638a14f27ba6050aaeee4cae96580a3341"
      >loopback.c (commit d9a5986)</a
    >
    for details.<br /><br />Please note that
    <code>FUSE_ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE</code> does not make a FUSE volume case
    insensitive. It only tells the system that the volume should be treated as
    such.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Xcode 5.1</li>
  <li>
    Xcode 5.1 does no longer support Objective-C Garbage Collection. Therefore
    Garbage Collection support has been disabled for OSXFUSE.framework. As a
    result the framework is now incompatible with applications using Objective-C
    Garbage Collection.
  </li>
</ul>
