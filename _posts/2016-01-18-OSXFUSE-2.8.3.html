<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved compatibility with Finder on OS X 10.11. Unless
    <code>allow_root</code> or <code>allow_other</code> is set we limit vnode
    operations to the user that mounted the file system. Starting with OS X
    10.11 <code>DesktopServicesHelper</code>, which is running as root, calls
    <code>access(2)</code> on behalf of Finder when trying to delete a
    directory. Blocking this request results in Finder aborting the delete
    process. Therefore we are no longer enforcing <code>allow_root</code> or
    <code>allow_other</code> for <code>vnop_access</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
