<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for Xcode 6.2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed race condition that can cause data corruption in case the unified buffer cache (UBC) is disabled.
        <br/>
        </br/>
        If a file vnode is being looked up while another thread is extending the file, the lookup thread might override the file's new extended size. As a result the write operation might fail with <code>EINVAL</code> or the file's content might become corrupted.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tracked as issue #179: <a href="https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/issues/179">"Data corruption in files with size not aligned to 4K"</a></li>
</ul>
