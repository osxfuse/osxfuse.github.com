<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Xcode 6.2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed race condition that can cause data corruption in case the unified
    buffer cache (UBC) is disabled.
    <br />
    <br />
    If a file vnode is being looked up while another thread is extending the
    file, the lookup thread might override the file's new extended size. As a
    result the write operation might fail with <code>EINVAL</code> or the file's
    content might become corrupted.
    <br />
    <br />
    Tracked as issue #179:

      >"Data corruption in files with size not aligned to 4K"</a
    >
