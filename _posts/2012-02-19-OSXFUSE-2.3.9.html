<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for building PowerPC file systems on macOS 10.6 and 10.7, if
    an appropriate version of Xcode is installed (e.g. Xcode 3.2.6). Tracked as
    issue #12:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/12"
      >"OSXFUSE 2.3.4 has no ppc compiled in"</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a race condition, that would lead to a file system deadlock. The
    deadlock could be triggered by a read/write operation in
    <code>fuse_internal_strategy</code> on a file, that another thread had just
    created (but not opened, yet).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a deadlock in <code>fuse_vnop_mmap</code> that affected certain file
    systems (i. e. MooseFS). It could by triggered by the file operation
    <code>VNOP_MMAP</code> which tries to authorize the action on the vnode
    corresponding to the file. In case the authorization is not already cached
    <code>VNOP_GETATTR</code> is called which caused the deadlock.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that could trigger a
    <code>vnode reclaim in progress</code> kernel panic on 32-bit kernels of
    macOS 10.6 and later. Tracked as issue #16:
    <a href="https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/16"
      >"vnode reclaim in progress - NTFS"</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue where Finder would report a wrong file size for files on
    sparse FUSE file systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue that caused Finder on macOS 10.6 and later to not display
    updated free/used space values for FUSE volumes. This is done by enabling
    capability <code>VOL_CAP_FMT_FAST_STATFS</code> by default and implementing
    the mount-time option <code>slow_statfs</code>. This option is interesting
    for network file systems where calls to <code>statfs</code> are expensive.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Set VFS I/O attributes for mount point when mounting a FUSE file system.
    This overrides system default values with the actual I/O size used by
    OSXFUSE resulting in very significant speed improvements. Based on a patch
    by Debabrata Banerjee.
  </li>
</ul>
